# OOD SOLID principles
SOLID is the acronym for the first five object-oriented design; (S) Single-responsibility, (O) Open-closed, (L) Liskov Substitution, (I) Interface Segregation, and (D) Dependency inversion

## Single-Responsibility Principle
meaning that a class should have only one job.

## Open-Closed Principle
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Interface Segregation Principle
clients shouldnâ€™t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
